                    To keep global warming to <b>no more than 1.5Â°C </b>
                    emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.
                    But how close are we in reaching our net zero commitments?
                    The <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement"> <b>NZE (Net Zero Emissions) Goal 
                    </b></a> made by the <b>United Nations</b> in the <b>2015 Paris Agreement</b> 
                    legally requires countries to work together to enable a worldwide transition away 
                    from fossil fuels to renewables for energy. But is the world on track to reach our NZE Goal by 2050?

                    The world map below shows the share of primary energy from each country that is derived from <b>renewable energy</b>. 
                    Most countries still generate less than half their energy using renewables, which is concerning as the adoption of renewables 
                    will need to significantly increase in order to reach NZE by 2050. Countries in <span class="colour-text">Africa</span>, 
                    <span class="colour-text">Northern Europe</span> 
                    and <span class="colour-text">South America</span> are leading the way with the highest share of renewables in their energhy mix.

                    In order to reach NZE by 2050, worldwide action is needed to reduce carbon emissions and slow global warming. Although the effects of global warming is felt across the world,
                    some countries release significanty more emissions than others. So <b>which countries are responsible</b> for releasing the most amount of carbon emissions? 
                    The top emitter in the world is <span class="colour-text">China</span>, followed by <span class="colour-text">United States</span> and <span class="colour-text">India</span>.
                    Contrary to expectations, rich countries with high GDP per capita do not necessarily release more emissions.
                    In the left scatter plot, LEDC countries are coloured in <span class="LEDC-text">light green dots</span> and MEDC countries are coloured in <span class="MEDC-text">darker green dots</span> 
                    <i>(based on a threshold earning of $10,000/capita GDP).</i>
                    Most <span class="MEDC-text">MEDC</span> countries consume more than <b>40,000 TWh of energy per person in a year</b>. Within  <span class="MEDC-text">MEDC</span> countries, <span class="colour-text">China</span> is the highest emitter releasing more than <b>10 million metric tonnes CO2/person per year</b>.

                    In recent years, there has been an increased uptake of renewables in the country, 
                    with around <b>11%</b> of energy sourced from solar, wind or other forms
